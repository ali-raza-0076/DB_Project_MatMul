SPARSITY COMPARISON (1000×1000 Matrices)
=============================================================================

Sparsity  | Dense GPU    | Sparse CPU   | Dense CPU    | Winner
----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------------
50%       | 0.001712s    | 0.623978s    | 1.898304s    | GPU (364x faster)
90%       | 0.001178s    | 0.084444s    | 1.784661s    | GPU (72x faster)
95%       | 0.001256s    | 0.025316s    | 2.083408s    | GPU (20x faster)
99%       | 0.001251s    | 0.001307s    | 1.880827s    | GPU (1x faster)

KEY INSIGHTS:
-------------

✓ At 50% sparsity: Dense GPU is 364x faster than Sparse CPU
  - GPU dominates with massive parallel processing advantage
  
✓ At 90% sparsity: Dense GPU is 72x faster than Sparse CPU
  - GPU maintains significant advantage even at high sparsity
  
✓ At 95% sparsity: Dense GPU is 20x faster than Sparse CPU
  - GPU still outperforms despite fewer non-zero elements
  
✓ At 99% sparsity: Dense GPU is essentially tied with Sparse CPU (1.04x)
  - This is the crossover point where specialized sparse algorithms
    become competitive with GPU brute force

CRITICAL FINDING:
The RTX 5070 Ti's raw computational power makes dense GPU operations
extremely fast even when dealing with sparse data. Only at extreme
sparsity (99%) does the sparse CPU algorithm become competitive.

Large     | 1500  | 0.003906s    | 0.019094s    | GPU (4.9x faster)

KEY INSIGHTS:
-------------

✓ GPU consistently outperforms Sparse CPU on all graph sizes
✓ Speedup ranges from 2.9x to 4.9x
✓ GPU particularly excels on larger graphs (4.9x on 1500 nodes)
✓ Sub-4ms execution time even for large graphs

GRAPH NEURAL NETWORK CONCLUSION:
For GNN operations on graphs with high sparsity (96-98%), the GPU
dense implementation is 3-5x faster than optimized sparse CPU code,
making it ideal for real-time graph processing tasks.
