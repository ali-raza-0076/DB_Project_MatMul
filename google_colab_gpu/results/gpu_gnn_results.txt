SUMMARY
=============================================================================

GPU times scale linearly with graph size:
- Small (500 nodes):   ~0.6 milliseconds
- Medium (1000 nodes): ~1.7 milliseconds
- Large (1500 nodes):  ~3.9 milliseconds

The RTX 5070 Ti handles even large sparse graphs (98% sparsity) with 
sub-4ms execution times, demonstrating excellent performance for GNN 
operations.

Key Observation: Despite high sparsity (96-98%), the GPU's dense matrix 
multiplication remains extremely fast due to hardware acceleration.
